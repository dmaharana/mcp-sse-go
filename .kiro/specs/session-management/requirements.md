# Session Management Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing session management in the HTTP MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. The session management system will track client connections, generate unique session identifiers, validate session headers, and maintain active session state to ensure proper request/response correlation and security.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an MCP server, I want to generate unique session identifiers for each client connection, so that I can track and validate client requests throughout their session lifecycle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client initiates a connection to the MCP server THEN the system SHALL generate a unique Mcp-Session-Id
2. WHEN generating a session ID THEN the system SHALL ensure the ID is cryptographically secure and globally unique
3. WHEN a session ID is generated THEN the system SHALL return it to the client in the initial response headers
4. IF a session ID generation fails THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate HTTP error status code

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an MCP server, I want to validate that clients include the Mcp-Session-Id header in their requests, so that I can ensure request authenticity and proper session tracking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends a request to any MCP endpoint THEN the system SHALL validate the presence of the Mcp-Session-Id header
2. WHEN a request contains a valid Mcp-Session-Id THEN the system SHALL process the request normally
3. WHEN a request is missing the Mcp-Session-Id header THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 Bad Request with an appropriate error message
4. WHEN a request contains an invalid or unknown Mcp-Session-Id THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401 Unauthorized with an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an MCP server, I want to maintain a registry of all active session IDs, so that I can validate incoming requests and manage session lifecycle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new session ID is generated THEN the system SHALL store it in the active sessions registry
2. WHEN validating a session ID THEN the system SHALL check against the active sessions registry
3. WHEN a session expires or is terminated THEN the system SHALL remove it from the active sessions registry
4. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL initialize an empty sessions registry
5. IF the sessions registry becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and reinitialize

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an MCP server, I want to implement session timeout and cleanup mechanisms, so that I can prevent memory leaks and maintain system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a session is created THEN the system SHALL set an expiration timestamp
2. WHEN the session timeout period elapses THEN the system SHALL automatically remove the session from the registry
3. WHEN a session is accessed THEN the system SHALL update the last activity timestamp
4. WHEN performing cleanup operations THEN the system SHALL remove all expired sessions
5. IF a client attempts to use an expired session THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401 Unauthorized

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an MCP server, I want to handle concurrent session operations safely, so that I can support multiple clients without data corruption or race conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple clients create sessions simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent operations without conflicts
2. WHEN accessing the sessions registry THEN the system SHALL use appropriate synchronization mechanisms
3. WHEN updating session state THEN the system SHALL ensure atomic operations
4. WHEN cleaning up expired sessions THEN the system SHALL not interfere with active session operations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an MCP server, I want to integrate session validation with all MCP endpoints, so that I can ensure consistent security across the entire API surface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is made to /mcp endpoint THEN the system SHALL validate the session ID
2. WHEN a request is made to /mcp/send endpoint THEN the system SHALL validate the session ID
3. WHEN a request is made to /mcp/receive endpoint THEN the system SHALL validate the session ID
4. WHEN a request is made to /mcp/abort endpoint THEN the system SHALL validate the session ID
5. WHEN session validation fails on any endpoint THEN the system SHALL return consistent error responses

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an MCP server, I want to provide detailed logging for session operations, so that I can monitor system behavior and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new session is created THEN the system SHALL log the session creation event
2. WHEN a session validation fails THEN the system SHALL log the validation failure with relevant details
3. WHEN a session expires or is cleaned up THEN the system SHALL log the cleanup event
4. WHEN session-related errors occur THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error messages
5. IF logging fails THEN the system SHALL continue operating without interruption
